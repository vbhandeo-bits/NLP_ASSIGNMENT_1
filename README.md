Part-of-Speech Tagging using Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs)
1. Assignment Overview
 Course: Natural Language Processing S2-25_AIMLCZG530
 Task: Implement a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from scratch for Part-of-
Speech (POS) tagging, use the Viterbi algorithm for decoding, and critically
evaluate its performance against a pre-trained POS tagger.
 Dataset: NLTK Brown corpus (Use Training Category: news Testing Category:
fiction)
 Note: 1 Mark is given for use of BITS Lab.
2. Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, students will demonstrate the ability to:
1. Formulate and implement the probabilistic framework of HMMs (Transition
and Emission matrices) from text data.
2. Design and code the dynamic programming-based Viterbi algorithm for
sequence labelling.
3. Address real-world NLP constraints, such as the "unknown words"
problem, using smoothing techniques or back-off models.
4. Critically evaluate machine learning models using standard sequence
labelling metrics and perform error analysis against established baselines.
Part 1: Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA) [2 Marks]
The objective of this part is to clean, analyze, and format a tagged corpus to extract
the transition and emission states.
a. Data Loading
b. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
c. Vocabulary Handling & Unknown Words
d. Sentence Padding
e. Data Splitting
Part 2: Model Architecture & Parameter Estimation [4
Marks]
Build a fundamental Bigram Hidden Markov Model from scratch. You must
calculate the probability matrices explicitly using maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) from the training set.
 Estimate the Transition Probability Matrix (A) and Emission Probability
Matrix (B) from the training data using Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(MLE).
 Implement a handling mechanism for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words
 Implement the Viterbi algorithm from scratch to find the most likely sequence
of POS tags for the test sentences. Your algorithm must take a sequence of
words as input and output the most likely sequence of hidden POS tags.
 Avoid using high-level wrapper libraries (like nltk.tag.hmm or sklearn) for the core
implementation. Vectorized implementations (e.g., using NumPy) are highly encouraged for
computational efficiency.
Part 3: Inference and Evaluation [4 Marks]
a) Sequence Inference (POS Tagging): Use your trained HMM and Viterbi decoder to predict
the POS tag sequences for any 4 test sentences. Pick sentences 2 from training dataset and 2
from test dataset.
b) Identify and print 3 distinct sentences where the Viterbi decoder misclassified at least one
tag. Briefly analyze why the model struggled with these specific words (e.g. lexical
ambiguity, rare transitions).
c) Run your Viterbi decoder across the entire 20% Test Set. Calculate and report:
a) Overall token-level accuracy.
b) A confusion matrix for the top 5 most common POS tags.
Part D: Baseline Comparison [1 Mark]
 Load a pre-trained, state-of-the-art POS tagger (e.g., SpaCy's tagger, Stanza, or
NLTK’s PerceptronTagger).
 Run the pre-trained model on the same test set. Discuss why your HMM failed
but the pre-trained model succeeded.
2. Deliverables
 Jupyter notebook with clear mention of all the members of your team
including Name and Bits ID.
 The notebook must execute from top to bottom without errors (Kernel ->
Restart & Run All must pass successfully). No cells should display execution
errors.
 Include explicit code output cells (or cleanly formatted markdown blocks
immediately following the code) showing:
 The EDA POS tag distribution bar chart.
 A heatmap or structured DataFrame snapshot of a portion of your
Transition Matrix.
 The decoded POS tag outputs for Test Sentences.
 The final Evaluation Accuracy and Confusion Matrix.
 Screenshots with test cases showing the inferences and predictions
 Screenshots showing use of BITS CSIS Labs.
 Any queries related tot his assignment should be addressed to Course LF, Ajay
